### Coding Section Practice Overview: JavaScript for CRM Interview Preparation  

This coding session is tailored for candidates preparing for a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) interview, focusing on JavaScript challenges that test algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. The session emphasizes practical exercises relevant to CRM systems, such as handling large datasets, implementing workflows, and optimizing performance.  

#### **Session Structure**  
1. **Concepts Refresher (15 minutes)**  
   - **CRM Context-Specific JavaScript Skills**:  
     - Handling JSON data efficiently.  
     - Writing modular, reusable functions to support workflows.  
     - Basics of API handling (GET/POST operations).  
   - **Key Data Structures**:  
     - Arrays and Objects for managing customer records.  
     - Maps and Sets for unique customer attributes.  
     - Queues and Stacks for process automation.  

2. **Foundational Exercises (20 minutes)**  
   Hands-on challenges to strengthen core JavaScript skills:  
   - Parse, filter, and sort customer data from a JSON array.  
   - Write a function to deduplicate customer records.  
   - Implement a system to track customer activity using a queue.  

3. **Algorithm Challenges (40 minutes)**  
   CRM-focused algorithm problems:  
   - **Searching and Filtering**:  
     Write a function to find customers with overdue invoices using binary search on a sorted dataset.  
   - **Recommendation Logic**:  
     Build a function to generate product recommendations based on customer purchase history using a hash map.  
   - **Data Transformation**:  
     Transform customer data into a specific format for reporting (e.g., aggregating purchases by month).  
   - **Workflow Automation**:  
     Simulate an email notification workflow using recursion and queues.  

4. **Integration Challenge (20 minutes)**  
   A CRM-relevant, real-world task:  
   - Write a function to fetch data from a mock API and calculate key metrics like the total sales per region or average order value.  
   - Optimize the solution to handle large datasets efficiently using pagination or memoization.  

5. **Code Review & Optimization Discussion (15 minutes)**  
   - Review solutions for maintainability, scalability, and performance.  
   - Explore alternative methods to solve the challenges.  
   - Discuss best practices for writing clean and modular code in CRM development.  

#### **Key Outcomes**  
- Strengthen algorithm and data structure knowledge in a CRM-specific context.  
- Gain practical experience with JavaScript tasks relevant to CRM systems.  
- Learn to optimize solutions for large-scale data handling and workflow automation.  
- Build confidence in tackling real-world CRM coding challenges during interviews.  

Participants are encouraged to engage actively, ask questions, and share their thought processes for collaborative learning. */
