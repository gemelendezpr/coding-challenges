// 1. TicTacToe board 

// Here are two ways we can figure out whether any row of a TicTacToe board has the same character in all its positions:

// Function to check if any row of a TicTacToe board has the same character in all its positions (Complex Version)
// Function to check if any row of a TicTacToe board has the same character in all its positions (Complex Version)
function sameRowComplex(board) {
    // Iterate over each row in the board
    for (const row of board) {
        // Check if all elements in the row are equal to the first element of the row
        if (row.every(val => val === row[0])) {
            return true; // Return true if all elements are equal
        }
    }
    return false; // Return false if no row has all equal elements
}

// Explanation:

// In this revised version:
// We use a for...of loop to iterate over each row in the board array.
// Within each iteration, we use the every method on the row array to check if all elements (val) in the row are equal to the first element (row[0]).
// If every element in the row is equal to row[0], we return true indicating that there is a row with all equal elements.
// If no such row is found after iterating through all rows, we return false.

// Function to check if any row of a TicTacToe board has the same character in all its positions (Simpler Version)
function sameRowSimpler(board) {
    // Explanation: Iterate through each row in the board.
    for (const row of board) {
        // Explanation: Check if the first and second elements of the row are equal,
        // and if the second and third elements of the row are equal.
        if (row[0] === row[1] && row[1] === row[2]) {
            // Explanation: If all elements in the row are equal, return true.
            return true;
        }
    }
    // Explanation: If no row with all equal elements is found, return false.
    return false;
}

// Explanation:

// Both functions sameRowComplex and sameRowSimpler take a TicTacToe board as input and return true if any row of the board has the same character in all its positions, and false otherwise.
// sameRowSimpler uses a simpler approach with nested loops to check each row of the board for equality of elements.
